# be-great-bot

Realised that I'm spending a lot of time in solitude in front of my laptop, so decided to create a telegram bot that sends me motivational and self-care messages to cheer me up. To make it a more interesting experience the bot sends the messages with a random delay between 10 minutes and 40 minutes.
